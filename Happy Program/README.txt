   ---   Happy Program README   ---    
This is a program that will randomly open an item when run. The program will open a single item and then end.
It is intended for the user to add things that make them happy to the list of items. Then the user can run the program to get random happy items presented to them.

Items the program will select are stored within the a Happy-Files folder within the same directory as the program.
This is for testing purposes. The intended use is for the Happy-Files folder to be located on the user's desktop.

When running the program for the first time, a setup procedure will be run which will create the required files and folders for the program.
These will be stored in the same folder as the program itself.

Items the progrm can open include:
 - Photos (Stored within a folder called Media within the Happy-Files folder)
 - Videos (Stored within a folder called Media within the Happy-Files folder)
 - Quotes (Stored within a text file called Quotes, each quote is stored on a separate line)
 - Links (Stored within a text file called Links, each link is stored on a separate line)

Photos, videos and links are opened using default programs set on the device. Quotes are opened within a separate GUI window.
