   ---   Speed Reader REAME   ---
This is a program which aims to help a user read a piece of text quicker than they usually would. This is done by display the text 1 word at a time with a very small amount of time between words.
The user can paste their text into the menu screen and specify how many words they would like to read per minute.
The program will calculate the number of miliseconds which must be between each word change to match the user's specified number of words per minute.

Punctuation will effect the duration between each word. 
- When any punctuation between the following square brackets [!?.] is found, the word the punctuation is next to will be displayed for 3 times as long as a normal word.
	This is because the punctuation defines the end of a sentence, where there should be a short break.
- When any punctuation between the following square brackets [,] is found, the word the punctuation is next to will be displayed for 2 times as long as a normal word.
	This is because the punctuation defines a short break in the middle of the sentence.
